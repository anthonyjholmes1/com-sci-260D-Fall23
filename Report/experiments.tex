\section{Experiments}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Present the design and execution of your experiments.
    \item Report on the data collected and any statistical or analytical methods used.
    \item Provide sufficient detail for others to replicate your experiments.
\end{enumerate}

We conducted our experiments with 50 epochs that way we would be able to run numerous methods without worrying about the runtime of each execution. We kept the epochs the same to ensure consistency in our results. We trained and tested numerous contrastive learning approaches against clean and poisoned imaged based datasets found online(CIFAR10 and CIFAR10C). The methods we used are SimCLR, Moco and CMC. 

From our clean data set experiments we found that SimCLR had the highest accuracy of 92.8% out of all the methods. The next method with the highest accuracy was Moco with an 87.9% accuracy. The final method CMC was the least accurate at 83.7%.  

Compared to our poison datasets the results were very similar in that the methods were in the same order of most accurate to least. There were significant drop offs in accuracy % in each method howeever. SlimCLR was averaging 68.2%, Moco was averaging 65.7%, and CMC was averaging 61.2% accuracy. 

We have create a github repository that contains links to our google collab file that can be used to run the contrastive learning approaches. We have also included comments within each section as to explain what each part of the code blocks do. Within the collab file there are different code blocks that refer to a specific method that if a user wants to only run a specific on they can easily do so. The user can also change the number of epochs they want to run if they wanted to see how that effects the accuracy.
