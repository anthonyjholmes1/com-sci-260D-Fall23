\section{Problem Formulation}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Clearly define the problem or question your research aims to address.
    \item Try to be formal here (use mathematical notation as far as possible)
    \item Clearly state the specific setting you are exploring rather than the overarching problem
\end{enumerate}
